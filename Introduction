# Introduction

The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) is the world governing body for men’s tennis professionals and runs the ATP Tour, the top competitive circuit for men’s tennis. Within this circuit, the world’s best male tennis players compete in multiple tournaments throughout the year-long season across the Singles and Doubles disciplines for ranking points and prize money. From this large number of matches each year, involving hundreds of different players, we would like to predict the outcome of a tennis match from attributes of a player themselves, particularly height or age, or their performance during the match.

Such data is contained within the dataset https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp, which we will use in our analysis. This dataset is a compilation of match results by year of the top 500 ATP men’s singles players from 1968 to 2021. The dataset contains information about characteristics of the players, such as their height and age, as well as various statistics of their performance within the game, such as the number of aces they hit. In our analysis, we will identify up to three predictors from this dataset that best predict match outcome. We will then use these predictors to create a classification model that predicts the outcome of a match. Given the large size of the dataset, we will confine our analysis to recent data from 2017 to 2019, and we will focus only on matches in the Singles discipline.
