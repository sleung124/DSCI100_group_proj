# Tennis KNN Classifier

An analysis of Men's Singles matches from 2017 to 2019. A KNN classifier was built in R using the optimal two variables, as the output of a model with two variables is easier to visualize. Exploratory analysis of relationships between predictors is first performed. Next, forward selection was used to select the most relevant predictors, and data is split into train and validation sets to select the most optimal number of neighbors. Finally, the classifier is trained using the best predictors and parameters, and evaluated with its accuracy score and confusion matrix output.  The accuracy of the model was around 70%, but it can be increased further by utilizing forward selection to find the optimal predictors.
